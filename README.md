SSWamp.exe

To resolve any domain like www.example.com on your local system, add the domain
name to your system hosts file:

1. Copy C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts to your desktop
2. Open the hosts file in Notepad
3. Add the following lines to the bottom of the hosts file:
4. 127.0.0.1  example.com
5. 127.0.0.1  www.example.com
6. Save the modified hosts file
7. Copy the modified hosts file back to: C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
8. Close your web browser if open
9. Run SSWamp.exe
10. Place a check next to the Apache option
11. Click Turn On
12. Test the configuration by opening your web browser to: http://example.com

Quick Solutions
---------------

firewall if prompted
